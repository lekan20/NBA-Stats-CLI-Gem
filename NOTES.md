I’m trying to decide between scrapping the list of nba team or songs from rap genius. The information would be a little different. The nba standing would be a lot more to initially return with a lot of other information I could pull while genius.com would be less things to scrap. I don’t want to over exert myself and put myself in a position where I feel overwhelmed but scraping the NBA standing has been my idea from the get go so I’ll do it.

Step 1

A command line interface that shows me the standings of all teams in the NBA from espn

1. Golden State Warriors
2. Houston Rockets
3. Boston Celtics
4. Toronto Raptors
5. San Antonio Spurs
